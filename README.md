#Just for me to learn about OOPs in python, feel free to use, might add stuff in C++ language later

I'll keep little notes of things that I learn here

*1. Use __init__(self, attributes) so that you can make multiple objects with same attributes

*2. You can put what DataType You want as input in __init__ by using (self, attribute: DataType) like str or float

*3. f"Hello {string literal}" in python

*4. with Assert you can accept input which passes some specific condition

*5. Class attributes can be accessed by it's member instances too
