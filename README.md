# Object Oriented Programming

## This is not a project, it's just for me to learn about OOP principles

I'll add small notes here and there 

  1. Use __init__(**self, attributes**) so that you can make *multiple objects* with *same attributes*.

  2. You can put what DataType You want as input in __init__ by using (**self, attribute: DataType**) like str or float.

  3. f"Hello {string literal}" in python.

  4. With **Assert** you can accept input which passes some specific condition.

  5. *Class attributes* can be *accessed* by it's *member instances* too.
