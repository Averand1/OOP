Just for me to learn about OOPs in python, feel free to use

I'll keep little notes of things that I learn here

Use __init__(self, attributes) so that you can make multiple objects with same attributes

You can put what DataType You want as input in __init__ by using (self, attribute: DataType) like str or float

f" HEllo {string literal}" in python

with Assert you can accept input which passes some specific condition

Class attributes can be accessed by it's member instances too
