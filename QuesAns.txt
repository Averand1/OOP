A class is created like this\
class Item:
    pass

item1 = Item() ##obj1
item2 = Item() ##obj2

What if we want to create an multiple objects which has specific attributes/properties without 
declaring them everytime?
-> For this we can use __init__ constructor

#Note An object passes itself in the method that's created inside the class if none are given

    item1.calculate_price() will call item1 itself if no arguments are passed
